# Reviewer Number 2

This project was made using react. This was made as satire of the Reviewer Number 2 memes. 

You can enter in your abstract onto the website at https://jaydahhei.github.io/reviewer2/ and receive a response from your very own Reviewer Number  2. You get a chance to submit a rebuttal, then an editor will decide if your paper should be accepted or rejected.

You can adjust the temperature of the LLM reviewer and editor responding to you. The higher the temperature, the more random the response will be.
